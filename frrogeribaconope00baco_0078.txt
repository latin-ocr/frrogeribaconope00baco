lxiv PREFACE.

11a1nes; whilst in the lacunae, which occur throughout
wherever the original Greek had to be quoted, and
the clumsy endeavours of the transcriher to represent
Greek words in Latin characters> show the justice of
his complaints against the inefficiency of copyists‚ and
the necessity of the reforms which he desired. To his
treatise on comparative grammar, in Corpus Christi
College, Oxford‚ he has silbjoinecl a short Greek acci-

‘⁴ Greek, Hebrew, Arabio, and Chaldee‚ so far as they
“ are of use to the Latins, here in the introduction of
“ my whole work upon grammar, and have indicated
‘⁶ the number and order of the books I shall now in
“ this first book proceed to speak of the Greek grammar

“ a coarse manner, then construe a few trifling passages
“ before they proceed to the higher science of the Latin
“ grammar, so I will first deliver superficially what is
“ preliminary‚ intending to introduce afterwards matter
“ of greater moment. Ι shall just set down what is
“ necessary for a smattering of reading and Writing,
“ then subjoin some passages for the use and exercise
“ of 1·eading.”
