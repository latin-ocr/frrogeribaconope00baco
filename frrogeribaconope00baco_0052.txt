xxxviii PREFAOE.

1116 books and copious extracts from 1116 Opus Majus
may be found in every great library. Not 60 1116
Opus Minus. It was comparatively unknown.

The evidence, already sufficiently strong 10 61111-
stant-,iate the autlienticity of this fragment, may be
closed by two observations: first, that 1116 same young
man, juvenis Johmmsst is mentioned as having been
sent With 1116 work 10 explain 116 difficulties and ex-
hibit certain experiments‚ as in 1116 Opus Majus2 and
1116 Opus Tertiumg and, secondly‚ 11161, like 111666 two
works, and unlike any other of Bacon’s works‚ 11 was
addressed 10 1116 pope.3 These are 1116 reasons which
have induced me 10 ascribe 11116 fragment without
hesitation 10 Roger Bacon, and affix 10 11 1116 11116
of 1116 Opus Minus. The necessity for entering thus
niinutely upon the identification of 1116 work, besides
1116 desire of reinoving long-established errors‚ will

more fully appear in the 660[1161.4

The Opus The same year which produced 1116 Opus Minus
Tertium. gave birth 10 1116 Opus Tertium. Much that might
have been said of 1116 11161161 and objects of 11116
11661166 1166 been anticipated already. Ι1 1166 been
frequently cited by Jebb in his preface 10 the
Opus Maius, and from 11 116 derived 1116 111061 striking
incidente of Bacon's history. F our original MSS. of
11116 work 61 16661 are known 10 6Χ161, but none of
an early date3 one 61 Douai rhas been described
in detail by 1116 veteran philosopher Victor Cousin,

not blunders of the transcriber,
, they would seem to imply, that this
fragment of the Opus Minus was an
