lx PREFACE.

“ not dare to translate the1n3 and certainly if he was
“ unacquainted with logic, he could know nothing of
“ other sciences as he ought. Nor did he understand
‘⁴ Arabio, as he confessed, because he was rather an
“ assistant in the translations, than the real translator.
‘⁶ For he kept Saracens about him in Spain, who had
“ a principa] hand in his translations. In the same
“ way Michael the Scot claimed the merit of numerous
‘⁴ translations. But it is certain that Andrew, a JeW,
