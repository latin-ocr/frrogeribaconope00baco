the attainlnent of all the rest. It is inore natural than
any other3 it is learnt with greater ease, for boys can
comprehend it 3 not so physics or metaphysics. It has
been always in the use and esteem of the wisc above
all other sciences. “The neglect of it for thirty or
“ forty years has nearly destroyed the entire studies of

Again:2 “ These reasons are of universal application 3
“ to descend to particulars would be nothing inore than

“ the sciences can not be known by logical and sophistical

It must, however, bo remembered that mathematics

in the language of Bacon had a wider significanee than
now. He included therein geometry‚ arithmetic, astro-
nomy, and 1nusic.3 In its application to theology it
embraced the heavenly bodies, geography, chronology,
the reformation of the calendar, numbers, geometr-y,
