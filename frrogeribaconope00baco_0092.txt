lxxviii PREFACE.

Two important divisions bring this scheme of
Bacon’s philosophy to a conclusion, general physics
and alchemy. ΤΟ the former belong the two treatises
of which some account has been given already, under
the title Communia Naturalium, in two parts.
The ‘heading prefixed to the work shows the nature
of its contents: “A volume of Natural Philosophy,
“ in which is delivered the science of Physics, ac-
“ cording to the force and comprehensiveness (potes-
“ tatem) of the eight natural. 601611066, which are enume-
⁴‘ rated in the second chapter. This volume contains
‘⁴ four principal books. 1. De comm-unibus ad omnia
“ nataralia. 2. De Ooelesabus. 3. Dc Elementis et
“ mixtis iizcmzimatis. 4. De Vegyetabilibus et Anima-
“ libas.” In the commencement of the second chapter
he thus explains what he means by the tei-ms 00911-
mama Naturalia: “I have stated in the fourth part
“ of my work on Metaphysics that there ought to
“ be 601116 60161106 of the Oommzmz'a Naturalia. For,
“ besides the special, there are many general laws
“ (gyenercasia) belonging to this great science. As Ι
“have composed a large scientific work, De Gom-
“ mmzibas Mathematiooe,¹ before I proceeded to
‘⁴ speak of its special parts, because the common
“ principles are many, difficult, and awful‚ 60 Ι will
‘⁶ not fail to follow the same order on this occa-
“ sion.'’ He then refers to the physics of Aristotle
as an example of what he 11166116, 111 the disser-

There is no question that these are
the genuinejworks of Roger Baeon
and part of the”Compendium Philo—
sophiae3 for at f. 7 8, b. of the same
MS. the following observation
occurs: “ Conceptiones primae in
‘⁴ geometria paucae sunt3 et ideo
‘⁴ prius positae sunt in tractatu de

Communibus totius Mathema-

“ ticae.’' Compare f. 5, b. of the
same MS. See below, p. 0.

In the Royal Library, F. vii. 1:141,
is a treatise‚ De Laudibus Mathe-
maticre. Ino. Post hanc scientiam
caper-[mentalem mathematica est
diynz’or et utilior respectu theoloyz'ae.
