OMITTING a great number of disputes which occurred
this year [AD. 1292] between the University and
the. town, I shall proceed to speak of a philosopher
the most, celebrated that England had hitherto pro-
duced3 I refer to Roger Bacou, a F ranciscan stiur, of

tho University of Oxford.

He was born of a good

fiunily, nob far from an ancient city called by Ptolemy

Ischalis, in modern times Ilohester.l

His first, years

were spent: ab OxforcL in the sbudy of grammar and
logio, where he made such unexpected progress that

quote from his Opus Tertium, Ross
concludes : “Haec nobilis doctor

theca, states that Baeon’s name,
before he took the vows as a Francis-
can, was David Dee de Raffik, and
he quotes in support of this strange
assertion a MS. of ΒΓ. Twyne,

VOL. Ι.

 

‘·' De Reform. Vulg. Cal.‚” now in
Corpus Christi College, Oxford.
There is no trace of this tradition
in Bacon's works, or in any oftho
notices preserved of him in the
Chronicles or Franciscan hisnu-ies.
It was not customary, so far as I
ean ascertain, for those who entered
the Franciscan order to change their
names. Tanner refers also to Atkyn’s
History of Gloucester for a tradition
that Bacon was born at Fodgmore
Bottom, in the parish of Bisley, in
the county of Gloucester‚ and
educated at the chapel of St. Mmy,
now Bury Mill, in thc parish of
Hampton, where a chamber is
still shown, called Bacou’s Study]
