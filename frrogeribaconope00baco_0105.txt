ΗΒΕ or ROGER BACON. xci

“ pans homines in omni superstitione et fraude reli-
“ gionis, quamvis fuerat philosophis odiosa et ab
“ omnibus debellata, ut certificabitur suo loco, tamen
“ sancti primitivi invenientes mundum occupatum in
‘⁴ utraque pro eodem artificio utramque reputabant,
“ quoniam ambae fidei fructum impediebant multis
“ modis. Nam sicut Magi Pharaonis Moysi resistebant
“ et populum AEgypti mandato Dei inobedientem facie-
“ bant, sic fuit in principio ecclesiae per artis magicae
“ violentiam. Quae cum in eundem effectum, scilicet
“ contra opus fidei, cum philosophia concordabat, totum
“ ejus vituperium in philosophiam redundabat.”

Some, in fact, imagined that Bacon was in alliance
with the Evfl One, and that by the aid of spiritual
agency he made a brazen head and imparted to it the
gift of spee0h3 and these magical operations, as Bale¹
states by mistake‚ were wrought by him whilst he was
a student at Brazen N ose Hall. Whether he did this
by the powers of natural magio is for the present a
question. Certainly John Ernest Bu1·gravius,2 in a
work on these subjeots, contends that Bacon was in-
debted to celestia] influences‚ and to the power of
sympathy' for these operations. To this 116 refers the
talking statues (statuae Mercuriales) and the brazen
head fabricated by Baccn, or, as some assert, by Al-
bertus Magnus. This was nothing else than natural
magio, in which Boethius was greatly skilled, and of
which 116 writes in these words to Cassiodorus :3 “Tuae
“ artis ingenio met-alla mugiunt, Diomedes in aere gra-
“ vius bueoinatur, aeneus anguis insibilat, aves simu-
“ latae sunt3 et quae vocem propriam nesciunt habere
“ dulcedinem cantilenae probantur emittere} '' How-
