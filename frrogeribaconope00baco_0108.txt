How he extricated himself I cannot say3 certain it
is that he complains to Pope Clement IV. that he was
deprived of the ordinary aids of study, and his books
and writings taken from him. “ My superiors and the
‘⁴ friars kept me on bread and water, suffering no one
‘⁶ to have access to me, fearful lest my writings should

“ .6611ῑ66.”1

But I put no faith in those who assert that the
pope sent for Bacon, and after examining him on the
charges brought against him, committed him to prison.
This is not at all probable‚ since the pope held Bacon
and his studies in great admiration, assisted him with
money, and advanced the young man whom he sent,
John of London. But that Bacon was cast into
prison by Raymund, 13116 general of his order,2 is
testified in a note appended 130 an ancient MS„
formerly in the library of the Earl of Dorset: “Here

his own general, eleven years before
he mounted the papal throne as
Nicholas IV. Nor by any inge-
nuity can the words aliquas novita-

charge of necromancy. The readers
of this volume will probably see

sufficient grounds, in the freedom
of Baeon’s theological opinions on
controverted topics, and the severity ¹
with which he assailed the oracles
of his order, for this mark of
his general's vengeance. No trace‚
however, of the story is to be
found in his writings‚ or in those
of his contemporaries, 01· even 111
