MS. in the

paper of the fourteenth century, very closely written,
and far from easy to read. This MS. has hitherto eluded
the search of Bacon's bibliographers, 111 consequence of
the 11110 prefixed to it by 001110 modern hand, De lavde
Sacra} Scriptum& and under this designation it is
quoted by Tanner as an independent work. It is 1111-
perfect, extending only to the close of the 45th chapter;
the rest has been lost. The catch—words of chapter xlvi.
are found at the bottom of the page.¹ It contains also
a portion of the Opus Majus in a somewhat different
hand. y

For 1110 unrestrained use of this MS. I am greatly
indebted to the liberality of his Gracc 1110 present
Archbishop of Canterbury.
