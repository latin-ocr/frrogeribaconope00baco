xvi PREFACE.

‘⁴ copied my works to serve themselves or others, with-
“ out any regard to my wishes3 as authors' works are
“ often pirated by the knavery of the transcribers at
‘⁴ Paris. And certainly, if it had been in my power to
“ have eommunicated my discoveries freely, I should
“ have oomposed many things for my brother the
“ scholar,l and for others, my most intima-te friends.
“ But as Ι despaired of the means of eonnnunioating
“ my thoughts, Ι sorbore to commit them to writing.
“ When, therefore, I professed to you my readiness,
“ you must understand that it was for writings to bo
“ composecL not for such as had boen oomposed already.
‘⁴ And therefore your ehapkmin, Raymond of Laon‚ was
“ altogether mistaken when he made mention of me to
“ your holiness. For although Ι had at various timos
“ put together, in a hasty manner, some few chapters
‘⁶ on different subjeets, at the entreaty of my friends,
“ there was nothing note—worthy in these writings3—
“ nothing of such a nature as I could think of pre-
“ senting to your wisdom. They were such as Ι inyself
‘⁶ hold in no estimatiom as being deficient in continuity
‘⁶ and perfeetion.'’ ‘·’

It appears, then, from these remarks, that Roger Eaeon
owed to Raymond of Laon his introduction to Cle-
ment IV. before the advaneenient of the latter to the
pontifioal ehair3 that the curiosity of the cardinal was
roused by the eominunieation so inado; that he
oommissioned Raymond of laon to express his
wishes to Rogei¹ Bac-on, and begged to be favoured
with a perusa] of some of his writings3 that Baeon
in return sent a gentleman of the name of Boneeor3
