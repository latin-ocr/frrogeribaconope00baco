After stating that Paul of Middleburg, who had
induced Oopernicus to turn his attention to this sub—
ject, had stolen half his work on the due observation
of Easter from Roger Bacon, Anthony Wood thus
concludes with some remarks on Bacon's writings.

1. Ι suspect, he says, that even the titles of many of
the books which Bacon composed have been lost, and
the copies of those which remain cannot be found with-
out extreme difficulty. Their existence is not known
through the envy or ignorance of their possessors.2

2. The works of Bacon which are generally found,
are deficient in many places or else redundant3 and
this may be said of those which are reckoned perfect.
Certainly in his work De Utilizeate Scienticwum there
occurs a question (not to mention other instances):
Utrum intellectus (essens sit pars cmi‘moe; in the
discussion of which the writer asserts that the affirma-
tionis agreeable to the teaching of Aristoffle, and was
held in his time by Robert Grostete and Adam de
Marsh, and that he had heard William of Auvergne‚
bishop of Paris, maintain the negative. This occurs
in the copy of the same work '3 in the library of
Sir Robert Ootton3 and yet in a copy of the same
ormerly belonging to Thomas AHen, and now among
the Digby MSS„ not a word of this is to be found.
Shall I further add, that the same work, which in the
Cotton Library is entitled De U &litate Scientiarum‚ is
