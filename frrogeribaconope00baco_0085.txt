of late been circulated among the Latius in a de-
fective and squalid version. Nor is it surprising if
I say that these books of logic are the best. There
are four kinds of true argument3 two move the
speculative intelleet, or the reason, 80. dialectics, by
“ 0 feeble and initiative habit, Which is opinion, that
“ we may 100 disposed to 00101100, which is 0 complete
and final habit, wherein the mind rests in the
“ contemplation of the truth. And this habit is not
“ acquired by demonstration.1 But as the will or prac-
“ tical intellect is more noble than the speculative,
“ and virtue With felicity infinitely excels 10010 001-
“ 01100, and is incomparably more needful to us, it 10
“ necessary that we should be furnished With argu-

especially as we 010 feebler 111 this respect than We
are in speculation. Willingly do we taste of the
“ tree of good and evil; slow 010 we to taste the
“ tree of life, to embrace the dignity of ‘virtue with 0
“ view to future happiness. It 10 necessary, therefore,
“ that the practica] intellec-t should have its due 01(ὶο

“ sciences have speculative arguments of opinion and
“ pure science, so the practical sciences, 00 theology and
“ ethics, embrace those arguments by which mankind
“ are excited to practice—-And these arguments in mat-
“ ters of our well-being are the strongest‚ but powerless
“ in pure speculati0n3 00 demonstration 10 most effica-
cious in bare speculation, but impotent in practice,
and in things which pertain to salvation. Logie
