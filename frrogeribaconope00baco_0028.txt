No legal son of the Holy See, if he would retain its
blessing and his birthright, might conti-acb affinity with
the devoted family.¹

But this enduring displeasure of the pope towards
England and the anti-royalists was sar from being
unfavourable to that acquaintance, which about this
time he appears to have contracted with Roger Bacon.
Unlike Grostete and Adam de Marisco, Bacon’s brothers,
all his family, and even the philosopher himself (so
far ab least as his devotion to science permitted him),
were zealous 0011101011ὺο to the royal cause. They had
sacrificed their forbunes (and they were evidently a
wealthy family) in behalf of the party they had es-
poused3 more than once they 1101οΓ drawn upon them-
selves the resentment of the victorious barons? The
political sacrifices, therefore, of Roger Baccn, nob less

mend him to a ponbiff who entered into all the disputes
of the time with the vehemence and ardour of a par-
tizan. Clement IV. had been a soldier in his youth3 and

towards this intimacy were made by 0101110111] IV. before
