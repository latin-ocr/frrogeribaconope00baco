lxxx PREFACE.

and man3 because knowing not what is prior, they
must remain ignorant of what is posterior.——Wherefore‚
through ignoranee of this seience, the ordinary natural
philosophy cannot be mastered‚ nor speculative and
consequently not practical medicine 3 not only
because natural philosophy and speculative medicine
are required for the practice of medicine, but
because all simple medicines of inanimate things are
derived from this seienee. For neither thc names

‘⁴ nor the significations of medicines can be learned,

except from this science3 that is, from speculative
alehemy, which speculates upon all inanimate things,

“ and the generation of all things from their elements.

“ There is also an operative or practica] alchemy

‘³ which teaehes man how to make noble metals

(ζ

and colours, and many other things, better and

“ more copiously by art than by nature. And this

(ί

science is more important than all that have pre-

‘ ceded, because it is productive of more advantages. It

not only provides money for a state, but teaches the

“ means of prolonging life, so far as nature will allow
“ it to be prolonged3 for we die sooner than we ought

for want of a proper regimen in youth, and owing

“ to diseased constitutions derived from our fathers.
‘³ But this twofold science of alehemy is scarcely
“ understood by any3 for although many through-
“ out the world labour to make metals and colom-s,
“ few know how to make colours truly and usefully3
“ scarcely any know how to make metals, and still

fewer to produce those things which avail for the
prolongation os life. There are very few who ean
distil properly, or sublime, or calcine, or resolve,
or perform other operations of this kind.”

He ought, then, in conclusion, and in conformity with

his design, to have treated of experimental philosophy
and of particular, the scienccs confirming by special
application the general and more abstract principles
