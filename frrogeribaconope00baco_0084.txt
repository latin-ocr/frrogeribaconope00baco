Logic.

Ixx PREFACE.

logio we 116176 1057 nature, its formal terms we obtain by
learning. This is obvious to common sense, for every
inan 66618116 the causes and reasons of his words and
actions, and of other things with whiclr he is familiar.
But this cannot be done except by an argument. All
men reply to falsehoods by denying them, and to
fallacies by saying‚ that it does not follow ‚ for this
reason or that. So, though 1657111611 (10 not understand
the logical terms which olerics use, they 116176111611,
own ways of meeting 6 16116010116 argument. And
therefore it is not the 60161106 01 10810, but 1116161106
only that 616 wanting to the laity. Then, after
stating that the discovery of logio presupposed the
existence of 6 logie and inode of investigation inde-
pendent 01 108 010, 1016 0116611 es “A knowledge of 166-

soning is given to man by nature as the means
“ 101 investig ating all other 601611066, and this we know
“ by 611116116110630101 though we have been taught the
“ science of reasoning by Aristotle⁷s logio, yet when
“- we handle the difficulties of other sciences‚ we pay
“ no regard to the art of Afisbotle, for we know
“ not whether the proposed inquiry be -a problem in
“ genus 01 species, or something else. Nor do we
“ know how we are to apply Aristotle to those
‘⁴ problems, nor could We explain how⁷ and yet we
“ know that we argue correctly.'’

In the Opus Majusl he developes more fully his
sentiments on this subject. Remarking on the vast
amount of errors introduced by the corrupt versions
of Aristotle‚ and the loss of his most valuable writings,
he observes: “Of his logio we have not the best
“ book3 and the next to it in excellence, the second,
‘⁶ 1166 106611 badly translated, and cannot be under-
“ stood, and is not in general use3 for it 1166 011157
