PREFACE. xlvii
had to construet tames, to illustrate his meaning by
diagrams, to treat abstruse and scientific questions, in
an age unaccustomed to scientific demonstration. To
gain the ear of the pope, whom he was anxious to
enlist in the cause of philosophy, he had to descend
to a style and manner clear and popular enough to
suit the ordinary capacity of one, whose sympathies
and good wishes constituted his only claim to be an
arbiter of science. No help was at hand3 no friends
to advise3 neither tables nor instruments to verify or
abridge his calculations. The translations from scien-
tific works of the Greek and Ara-bian were utterly
worthless3 MSS. of the originals not to be procui-ed.
The copies of Bacon's own works, as they exist at the
present day, afford unmista-keable evidence of the ob-
tuseness of his transcribers, ignorant of every language
but the Latin, unaccustomed to scientific terms, indif-
ferent to criticism.1 FriendleSS, unaided by his family,
thwarted by his superiors, if not discountenanced
by the very pope who had enjoined the task, he
had nothing but the force of his own genius and his
unconquerable love of the truth wherewith to surmoimt
these overwhelming difficulties. In what estimation
modern philosophy may hold his researches it is not
easy to decide; but in his vast and unwearied labours
in the cause of science‚—that Α never-failing charac-
teristic of true scientific insight,—Roger Bacon may
fairly take rank with the greatest pioneers of modern
discovery.

¹ These treatises afford many
amusing examples of the state-
ment in the text. Unable to write
Greek, or read it when written, in
almost all instances the scribes have
transferred into Latin characters
their notions of a Greek equivalent.
Sometimes they have omitted the

Greek altogether, as the reader may
see in a variety of places in the
Compendium studii. On other oc-
casions, where Bacon denounces the
erroneous orthography os his own
time, and gives reasons for correct-
ing it, they adhere to their ancient
mumpsimus with unshaken gravity.
