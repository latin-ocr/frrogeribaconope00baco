Studii Philosophiae, is taken from 6 unique MS. in the
British Museum‚ Tiberius GV„ already described.¹
A copy, made by XVilliamson and Casaubon, is in
the volume of Gale's transcriptas, containing the Opus
Tertium and Opus Majus, now 111 Trinity CoHege,
Cambridge? No other MS. is now known to exist.
No trace of it is to be found in the long and intricate
catalogue of Baeon’s writings compiled by 13616, by
Ρ1116, by Tanner, or the 61116 editors of the Biographia
Britannica. After adopting and rejecting various titles
