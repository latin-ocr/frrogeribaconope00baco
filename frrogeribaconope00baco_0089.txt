“ The second roob of 'ohe difficulty is ‘ohat'we oughb
“ to have excellenb mathematicians, who should nob
. “ only know whab exists, original or branslabed, in
“ connection with the sciences‚ but, be able bo make
“ additions to them, which is easy for good mathema-
“ ticians ’no do. For there are only two perfecb mathe-
“ mabicians‚ Master John of London‚ and. Mas‘oer Peter
‘⁶' de Maharn-Curia‚ a Picard. There are hwo other
“ good ones, Master Campanus de Novaria, and Masber
‘⁶ Nicholas, 11116 tea-cher of Aumary cle Monbfort-,J For
“ Withoub mahhemabics nobhing worth knowing in phi-
“ Iosophy can be attained. And therefore it is indis-
“ pensable ‘uhab good mathematicians be had, who are
“ very scarce. Nor can any one obtain their services,
“ especially the besl] of fflem, excepi] ib be the pope or
“ some great prince. For he would hardly condescend
“ to live with any ono who wished 10 be the lord of
‘⁶ his own sbudies, and proseoufie philosophica] investi-
“ gabions ab his pleasure.
“And besides bhese expenses‚ other grea’o expenses
“ would have bo be incurred. Withoub mathematical
‘⁶ instruments no science can be masbered3 and bhese
“ instrumen'os are nob to be found among the Latius,
“ and could 11013 106 made for two or bhree hundred
“ pounds. And besides, better tables are indispensably
“ requisite, for al'ohough the certifying of the bables is
“ done by instruments, yeb this cannot] be accomplished

“ unless there be an immense number of instruments;
