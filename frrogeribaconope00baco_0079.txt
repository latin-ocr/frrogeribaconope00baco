On the Greek grammar which professed to be written
by Aristotle, he observes: “This first chapter is to
“ cantion my readers against the many mistakes com-
“ mitted in a treatise on grammar which professes to
“ be translated from Aristotle into Latin. It is,
‘⁶ however, none of his. As, in accordance with what
“ I consider proper to grammar, I have explained
‘ what appertains to the substance of the letters, the
“ substantial power of their sound, their distinction
‘⁶ and their number, as well in Latin as in Greek, I
‘⁵ now wish to explode some mistakes generally made
“ on this subject. And first I proceed to what is
“ written in a treatise 011 grammar which begins thus:
‘⁴ scientia est 0νῶἱήαὲίο depicta in [anima universi-
“ tatis et diversitatis offensatoramst Some put too
“ much trust in this work, and erring themselves, often
“ lead others into error. It cannot be a work of
“ Aristotle’s, as is generally supposed, nor yet of any
“ Greek, for the Greek grammar is not set forth
“ according to Greek characters (figym‘a), but rather
‘⁴ according to the Latin, although some few Greek
“words are insisted on3 but it is obvious that
“ a Greek grammar, by a Greek, would be treated
“ after a Greek model. Therefore this treatise was
“not composed in Greek, nor translated from the
“ Greek, but some Latin eompiled it out of his own
‘⁴ head. For he says frequently ‘ We Latius (7103
“ ‘ Latini) do so and so, and the Greeks otherwise 3'
“ therefore the author was a Latin, and not a trans—
