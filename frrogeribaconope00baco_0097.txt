PREFACE. lxxxiii

ΤΟ 5657 11161 1115 aspirations far outstripped all
that he, or that science in its most perfect state,
could be expected to realize, is to charge him with
no greater error than what is common to all enthu-

also with minds of great and comprehensive grasp,
his vivid perception of the intimate relationship of
the different parts of philosophy, and his desire to
16156 himself from the dead level of any individual

whole. The 61101510 all directions, of which he was
fully cognizant, perhaps something of the 60057οΙ0016-

to theology‚ led him to undertake so gigantic a task,

ambition of the grandest and most daring intellects.

it right to enter on these details. If of little value in
themselves, 111657 01657 61 least serve as guides to some
future editor of Bacon's works, and point out in what
direction 1115 16566101165 should 116 directed. But Whilst
so large a portion of these works exists only in
MSS, widely dispersed in different libraries‚ it
