lxvi . PREFACE.

‘⁴ lator, for translators do not put into their texts
“ what they do not find in their originals. Seoondly,
“ it cannot be Aristotle’s‚ or any wise man’s 3 for he
“ who oomposed the work blunders in substance and
“ mood; for „he aoknowledges as much when he says,
“ Eoecedo {qitzar artis metas et scientim terminos
“ (licendo de uatum vocis et som: ‘modo ‘metaphorica
“ Resides, he investigates the order of the soienoes
“ after his own method, in order to arrive at grammar.
“ But no grammarian needs suoh an arrangement in
“ order to treat upon grammar 3 no grammarians do so,
“ nor ought they, as grammar is the first of all soienees
“ in the way of teaohing. Nor can a pupil in grammar
“ understand the properties of other soienoes, which are
“ strictly posterior in order, and still less known to
“ him than grammar itself.1 And therefore he is a fool
“ who, in teaohing grammar, begins with a division of
‘⁶ other soienoes; and therefore I suppose that this is
‘⁴ not the work of a wise man, but of one who thought
“ that he knew more than he did know. And no
“ wise man oan doubt but that all whioh is there
‘⁴ said of the division of the soienoes‚ of the generation,
“ power, and properties of letters, is either false, or
“ vain, or absurd. And this may be seen in my
“ treatise on Metaphysios‚ and other treatises upon
“ the division of the soienoes. I shall not, therefore,
“ on this oooasion disouss the division of the scientes,
“ as set down by this author, but in my Metaphysios
“ and elsewhere I have strangled all that is here
‘¹ advanoed, as foolish and erroneous, and besides the
“ subject. It is the business of the natura] philosopher,
“ and nretaphysioian, and musioian to explain the
“ rationale of the generation of sounds and voices,
