111116, but whose name he forbears to mention, Bacon
010561·1765;1 “The above—named incompetent author
“has no more real acquaintance with philosophy
“ than the rest of the vulgar. There are not five
“ men in Latin Christendoni who are acquaintcd
“ with the Hebrew, Greek, and Arabic grammar. Ι
“know them well, for I have made diligent in-
“ quiry on both sides of the sea, and laboured
“ much in those things. There are many persons=
“ among the Latins who 6611 speak Greek, Arabio,
“ and Hebrew, very few who understand the gram-
“ mar of these languages, or know how to teach them,
‘⁴ for I have put many to 1116 test. For as the
“ laity speak languages which they have learnt,
“ yet know nothing of 1116 grammar, so is it with
‘⁴ these men. I have seen many laymen who spokc
“ Latin admirably well, yet knew nothing of the
“ rules of graminar3 and so is it now with almost
“ all the Jews, and even the native Greeks, and
“ not merely with the Latins who understand
“ Greek and HebreW. For as the Jews and the
“ Greeks have lost the wisdom of God, and with it
the wisdom of philosophy, there are very few among
1116111 who can teach the grammar correcffly, and
‘⁴ give the rules and the reasons of it, as we Latius
“ understand our grammar by the help of Priscian.
‘⁴ And even when they do understand the lan-
“ guages, they know nothing of the sciences. And
‘⁴ therefore they cannot translate or do anything use-
“ ful, or intermeddle in studies 10 any good purpose,
“ although they may be apt and indispensable 65-
