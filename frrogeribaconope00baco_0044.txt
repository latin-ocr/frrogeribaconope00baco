Fearful that he had not expressed himself with
sufficient clearness in this his first and fullest answer to
Clement's demand, or dreading lest it might loe lost by
the way, Bacon proceeded the same year to compose a
second treatise‚ called the Opus Minus, now for 1116 first

time printed in this volume.

Unfortunately the only

MS. of the work, which has yet been discovered, is a
fragment, preserved in 1116 Bodleian Library, Digby,
No. 218. The MS. 18 written on vellum, in double
columns7 in a hand of the Mth century. 3 The first
page has been injured, and the handwriting is occa-

¹ It is not meant by this, impres-
sions on our senses, merely.

² Dr. Whewell thus sums up his
estimate of the work. “ The Opus
⁸· Majus is a work equally wonderful
‘⁵ with regard to its general scheme,
⁶· and to the special treatises with
‘² which the outlines of the plan are
·‘ filled up. The professed object
⁸* of the work is to urge the neces-
·“ sity of a reform in the mode of
‘⁸ philosophizing‚ to set forth the
‘⁸ reasons why knowledge had not
“ made a greater progress, to draw
‘⁴ back attention to the sources of
‘⁶ knowledge which had been un-
“ wisely neglected, to discover other
‘¹ sources which were yet almost
“ untouched, and to animate men
“ in the undertaking by a prospect
“ of the vast advantages which it

‘⁵ offered. In the development ofthis
·‘ plan, all the leading portions of
‘⁵ science are expounded in the most
‘⁶ complete shape, which they had at
⁴* that time assumed3 and improve-
“ ments of avery wide and striking
‘⁶ kind are proposed in some of the
‘⁴ principal of these department&
‘⁶ Evenif the work had had no lead-
“ ing purpose it would have been
‘⁶ highly valuable as a treasure of
‘the most solid knowledge and
‘⁶ soundest speculation of the time ;
“ even if it had contained no such
‘⁸ details, it would have been a work
“ most remarkable for its general
“ views and scope. It may be con-
“ sidered as at the same time the
“ Encyclopoedz'a and the Novum Or·
⁴ yanum of the thirteenth century.’⁵
