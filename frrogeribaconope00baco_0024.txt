X PREFACE.

to entitle Compendium Philosophiae, for reasons to be
presently stated, no notice is to be found, with the ⁹
exception of two meagre and vague references made to
it by Jebb in the volume already referred to. It
appears from his statement, which will be considered
hereafter‚ that Jebb regarded the Compendium Philoso-
phiae as forming a second and enlarged, edition of the
Opus Minus.l

To remove some of the mis-conceptions existing in
reference to these treatises, and the many errors
occasioned by the variety of their times, I propose
to give a brief account of their literary history.
The publication of the present volume supplies mate-
rials hitherto unknown to the biographers of Roger
Bacon‚ and more obvious means for correcting pre-

vious mistakes.

scholar Ι wish to speak with
unfeigned respect. English litera-
ture is much indebted to his dis-
interested‚ zealous, and indefatigable
exertions. He was born at Not-
tingham, educated at Peter House

in Cambridge, attached himself to ¹

the non-jurors, and became librarian
to the celebrated Jcremy Collyer.
He appeared as an author at an
early age, printing during his resi-
dence at Cambridge, in 1718, a
translation of ‘⁶ Martyn's answers
‘⁴ to Emlyn.” On leaving the Uni-
versity he married a relative of a

Mr. Dillingham, an apothecary in ,

large practice in Red Lion Square.
From Dillingham he received les-
sons in chemistry. His son, after-
wards Sir Richard Jebb, the eminent
physician, well known to the readers
of Boswell's Johnson, was born at

 

Stratford in Essex, in 1 7 29,where his

his edition of Bacon’s Opus Majus,
published in 1733, and dedicated to
Dr. Mead. He died in the enjoy-
ment of a comfortable fortune, ac-
quired by his profession, on the
9th of March 1772. The brother of
whom he speaks, in his preface to

’ the Opus Majus, as first drawing

his attention to a copy of that work
among the MSS. of Trinity College‚
Dublin, was undoubtedly Dr. John
Jebb, the Dean of Cashel, father of
the Cambridge reformer. Awasp-
ish notice of him occurs in Hearne's

’ Reliquiae, p. 665, under the year

1727.
