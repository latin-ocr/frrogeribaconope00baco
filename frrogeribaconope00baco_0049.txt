PREFACE. xxxv

schoohnan, whose wribings by 110 means justified the
incense he received, Bacon 111116 proceeds: ‘⁴ 11, is 1101,
“ without·1 reason thais I have said 111666 bhings of this
“ author 3 1101, merely because 11, serves my purpose, hub
‘⁴ it is melancholy ‘oo think thais 13116 study of philosophy
“ should have been more perverbed by him 'ohan by
⁴⁴ any other wriber 'uhab ever lived among the Latius.
‘⁶ For though 0111616 had 111611· failings, they did nob
‘⁴ presume upon 'cheir authorsty3 whereas 11116 man
“ writes his book in a dogmatica] form (per ‘modum
“ authew'zticum), and so is quoted and alleged by 1116
“ whole herd of madmcn ab Paris, as if he were an
“ Arisboffle, 01· an Avicenna, or an Averroes, or 1116
“ like. He has occasioned great debriment, 1101, only 1,0
‘³ science, 11111, bo bheology, as I have shown in my Opus
“ Minus,l where I speak De Septem Peccatis Stude&
“ Theoloffz‘oe. The Third Error (Tertium Peccatum)2
‘⁶ is more particularly levelled against] him. Ι 1101111,

“ the principal. The 011161· (Alexander ab Hales) has
“ a grea‘oer name, 11111, 116 is dead. This 16 patenis
“ enough in the Opus Majus and the Opus Minus, &c.”
Now, on comparing ‘ohe aecoum here given with tho Opus
fragmenb published ab p. 313 of this volume, no (1011111, Mmus.
can remain of that fragment constibubing a portion of
the genuine Opus Minus. The same conclusion is forced
upon us by other remarks3 as ab p. 33, where ‘ohe
wriber says: “Withouss Greek and Hehrew ‘ohe Latius
“ can know nothing magnificcnb 01· worbh knowing, as
“ Ι have shown clearly in the third parf, of 1116 Opus
“ Majus, and in the Opus Minus, where I speak of
“ the sbudy of theology 3 viZ„ in the Third, F isth, and
‘⁴ Sixth Error (peccatum).” Aoain, ab p. 41, 116
states that he had spoken of speculassive alchemy
